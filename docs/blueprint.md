## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich purple (#A050A0), referencing magic and nobility within the game's universe.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E0D0E0), a soft, desaturated hue of purple, to ensure comfortable readability.
- Accent color: Deep rose (#D05070), for interactive elements and highlights, analogous to the primary purple but providing necessary contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Playfair' provides an elegant, fashionable feel for headings, while 'PT Sans' ensures readability in body text.
- Elegant icons representing rewards and status. For example, a chalice could represent 'Blessing of the Gods'.
- Use a tabbed interface, with tabs such as 'My Profile', 'Leaderboard', 'Redeem Rewards', 'Admin'.
- Subtle transitions and animations when points are awarded or redeemed, providing engaging user feedback.
